本 post 在 `_posts` 目录中。去编辑然后 re-build 本站就能看到你所作的改变了。 你有很多种方法 rebuild 本站，但最常用的方法是运行 `jekyll serve`，这会启动一个 web server 并且当有文件改动时，会自动生成你的网站。

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
